DEAR SIR,

Kindly use the following steps for exection of the program:

1. We could directly give the ECG data from the SUBSYSTEM-1 to this system, but after execution it will be like 162 images prompting one after again which are not clear to examine and also will make the system hang. So, we modeled this code for examining the single ECG Signal. But in practical we could modify this code to execute for multiple input signals using 'LOOPS' and high performing GPU Hardware.

2. This "SUBSYSTEMS-2" folder contains ".mat" files of ECG Signals. 

3. When you execute code, a dialogue box will open to select the ECG Signal. Then select any one of these signals

4. You can also download any ECG Signal from MIT-BIH database and can test it.

5. Just make sure, that the ECG whose QRS Peaks and Heart Rate to be determined, is in the current working directory of MATLAB.

6. For sampling rate, we can give any value but all the signals from the MIT-BIH database have a standard value of "360" as sampling rate. So, with 360 sampling rate, we will get the result with maximum accuracy.

THANK YOU,
